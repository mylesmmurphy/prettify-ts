# Prettify-ts

Prettify-ts is a Visual Studio Code extension that enhances your TypeScript development experience. It provides hover information for TypeScript types, classes, interfaces, and more, formatted in a more readable way.

## Disclaimer

Prettify-ts is currently, at best, a working proof of concept. The project is still in its early stages of development and may have limitations or bugs.

If you encounter any problems or have any feature requests, please feel free to open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.

## Features

- **Hover Information**: Just hover over a type, class, interface, etc., and you'll see a prettified version of its declaration in the hover panel.

## Usage

1. Install the extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.
2. Open a TypeScript file in Visual Studio Code.
3. Hover over a type, class, interface, etc., to see the prettified declaration in a hover panel.

## Toggle

Use the `Prettify TS: Toggle Hover` command to enable or disable the hover information feature provided by the Prettify-ts extension.

Use the `Prettify TS: Toggle View Nested Types` command to show or hide nested type information.

## Note from the developer:

Thanks for trying my extension! This is my first VSCode extension, and also my first time working with the TypeScript AST (Abstract Syntax Tree). Any code optimizations would be greatly appreciated.

Special thanks to [@mattpocock](https://github.com/mattpocock) for the Prettify Type, and to [@willbattel](https://github.com/willbattel) for Beta testing, providing feedback, and overall improving this tool!
