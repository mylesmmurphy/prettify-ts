# Tests

Use Node 24 and the pinned pnpm version.

- pnpm typecheck checks the plugin, extension, integration tests, and unit entry points.
- pnpm lint checks TypeScript and formatting.
- pnpm build builds the plugin and extension.
- pnpm test:unit runs compiler-backed semantic/parser regressions, client/cancellation/configuration tests, and packaging failure cleanup.
- pnpm test builds and runs the editor integration suite.
- pnpm test:package builds a VSIX, installs it in an isolated profile, and runs the integration suite using the installed artifact directory as the test extension.

The reproducible editor baseline is VS Code 1.100.0 with Vue - Official 3.1.1. The normal editor run uses that editor's bundled compiler. CI also tests the current stable editor/latest Vue using workspace TypeScript. Linux editor tests require xvfb-run -a.

Environment selectors:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| PRETTIFY_TEST_VSCODE_VERSION | Editor download version; default 1.100.0, or stable for the canary |
| PRETTIFY_TEST_VUE_EXTENSION_VERSION | Vue editor extension version; default 3.1.1, or latest |
| PRETTIFY_TEST_USE_WORKSPACE_TYPESCRIPT | Set to 1 to select the workspace compiler |
| PRETTIFY_TEST_VSCODE_PATH | Reuse a cached editor executable |
| PRETTIFY_TEST_EXTENSIONS_PATH | Reuse an already prepared isolated extensions directory |
| PRETTIFY_TEST_TYPESCRIPT_PATH | Alternate compiler module for test:unit |

Each editor run uses a disposable workspace copy. Settings updates and Vue edit regressions do not change tracked fixtures. Extension installation also uses explicit isolated profile and extension directories.

Type-output assertions request the plugin and use the real renderer, so a native TypeScript hover cannot hide a plugin failure. Editor registration, actual unsaved-file hover/copy, workspace toggling, and private-member copy behavior have separate integration coverage. The unit suite additionally parses emitted types and checks mutual assignability for representative complete expansions. Fresh-install defaults are checked against the shared options definition.

The built formatter is loaded from development output by type-output assertions even during installed-VSIX runs; actual hover/copy integration tests exercise the installed bundled renderer. Run the build before invoking the test CLI directly.

Run editor suites sequentially on the same desktop: clipboard integration tests share the system clipboard. CI jobs use separate machines.
